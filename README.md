# DatabaseProxyUsingAOPSample
Sample project describing using method proxy to apply transaction to all methods without ruining database code.  
This sample project is an alternative implementation of
[DatabaseProxySample](https://github.com/crowjdh/DatabaseProxySample) using Spring AOP Framework.
  
Adopting AOP Framework could some complicated setup process but it does help developers to improve maintainability
of your code.
